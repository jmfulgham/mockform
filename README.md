Mock sign up form for hotel

This is a small project that has allowed me to play around with forms and CSS a little more.
My goal here is to learn a little more about responsive layouts and forms. Also I used plain JavaScript to handle
the form instead of jQuery; using jQuery would have been a little faster, but my aim is to solidify concepts in plain
JS.

## Next Steps
I need to tweak the responsiveness a bit more. The sections pushed to the right when I play with 
the layout in the Inspector. However, I'm happy with the initial product, even though it's 
still a work in progress.
