### Background
I got the idea to do this small project after checking out some web design assignments on briefbox.me. Briefbox is great resource for design projects if you're looking to add to your portfolio. 

This has allowed me to play around with forms and responsive CSS a little more. This project also has introduced me to the flexbox CSS model.
